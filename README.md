Welcome to my Power BI Dashboards Repository! This repository contains a collection of Power BI projects, each with their own set of reports, visualizations, and data sources. These dashboards can be used for a variety of purposes, including business intelligence analysis, data exploration, and performance monitoring.

## Getting Started

To use the Power BI dashboards in this repository, you'll need to have Power BI Desktop installed on your computer. You can download Power BI Desktop for free from the [Microsoft website](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/en-us/desktop/).

Once you have Power BI Desktop installed, you can download a dashboard project from this repository by clicking on the project folder and downloading the .pbix file. Then, open the .pbix file in Power BI Desktop and start exploring the dashboard!

Each project folder contains a README.md file that describes the purpose of the dashboard, the data sources used, and any other relevant information. You can also find screenshots of the dashboard.
